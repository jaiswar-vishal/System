How we'll learn each topic

Every chapter will follow the same proven learning cycle:

Intuition first – Understand the concept with a real-world analogy before seeing code.
Memory visualization – Draw stack, heap, variables, and pointers so you can "see" what the program is doing.
Minimal code – Start with the smallest working example.
Real-world example – Solve a practical problem using the concept.
Common mistakes – Learn the bugs professionals actually encounter and how to avoid them.
Debugging session – Step through the code using gdb (which you've already started learning) to observe runtime behavior.
Exercises – Progress from easy to interview-level questions.
Mini project – Apply the chapter's concepts in a small but complete program.
Active recall – Answer conceptual questions from memory without looking at notes.
Spaced revision – Revisit the concept after 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month with progressively harder problems.
Coding rules we'll follow from Day 1

Always compile with:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g file.c -o app
Fix every warning instead of ignoring it.
Draw memory diagrams for pointer-related code.
Use the debugger to understand execution, not just to find bugs.
Write small, testable functions with clear responsibilities.
Learn why something works before memorizing syntax.

This approach will build both deep understanding and long-term retention.

Our first lesson will be Chapter 1: How a C program actually becomes a running process, where you'll learn the complete journey from source code (main.c) to machine code, executable, loading into memory, and execution by the CPU. That foundation will make every later topic much easier to understand.
